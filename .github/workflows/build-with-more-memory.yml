name: Build and Test (with optional increased memory)

# This is an example workflow showing how to run Vite builds and Playwright tests
# with Node's heap increased to 16 GB using the explicit `node --max-old-space-size`
# invocation. This avoids adding any repository-level dev dependencies while giving
# CI jobs the memory they need.
